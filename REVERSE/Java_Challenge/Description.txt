💡 Hints
The program behaves differently with command-line arguments

Not all code paths are executed during normal operation

Some methods are never called but contain important information

Look for string manipulation and encoding patterns

Multiple classes work together to build the final flag

🛠️ Recommended Tools
JD-GUI - Java Decompiler (GUI)

CFR - Another Java decompiler

javap - Built-in Java class file disassembler

Bytecode Viewer - All-in-one analysis tool

Any text editor - For examining decompiled code

🎯 Solving Tips
Start by decompiling the JAR file

Examine all class files, not just the main one

Look for unused methods and dead code

Pay attention to static initializers and constructors

The flag is assembled from multiple parts

🏆 Learning Outcomes
Understanding Java bytecode structure

Recognizing common obfuscation techniques

Analyzing control flow in compiled code

Extracting hidden data from binaries

"Sometimes the most important things are hidden in plain sight... or in this case, in the bytecode!"
